<h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>
<p> We referenced <a href="http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf">this</a> paper when implementing our fluid simulation. It modfies the SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) method for particle-based fluid simulation, using the unconditionally stable PBD (Position Based Dynamics) framework to facilitate real-time applications. It also modifies PBD by replacing Gauss-Seidel iteration with Jacobi iteration. In this method, we have one constraint equation for each particle, based on the positions of all other particles. We have a set of initial positions of the particles, and in each time step we iteratively update each particle's position individually by plugging the positions of the rest of the particles from the last time step into its constraint equation. Here we provide a simplified overview of the method outlined in the paper. </p>
<p>
We get the constraints using the ratio between the SPH density estimator \(p_i\) and the rest density \(p_0\). We want the density of the fluid to stay close to the rest density, so the particles should move in a way that brings this ratio closer to 1. Each particle's constraint (which is a function of the position of all the other particles) is the difference between the current ratio and the ideal ratio of 1:
$$ \frac{p_i}{p_0} - C_i(p_1...p_n) = 1 $$</p>

<p>The SPH density estimator \(p_i\) is defined as follows: 
$$ p_i = \sum_{j}W(p_i - p_j, h) $$</p>
<p>\(W\) represents the weight function, which defines how much the effect of each particle \(p_j\) on the current particle \(p_i\) decreases as a function of their distance \(p_i - p_j\) . In this case, we are using the Poly6 kernel, which looks similar to a Gaussian distribution. </p>

<p>We're looking for a particle position correction \(\Delta p\) such that \(C(p + \Delta p) = 0\), meaning the particle has moved such that \(\frac{p_i}{p_0} = 1\). </p>

<p>We know that \(\Delta p = \nabla C(p)\lambda\), where \(\Delta C\) is the gradient of \(C\) (roughly, the vector direction the particle should be moving in) and \(\lambda\) is a scaling factor. Using a series of Newton steps along the gradient, we have 
    $$ (C(p + \Delta p)) \approx C(p) + \nabla C^T \nabla C \lambda $$

<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>
    <p>In this section, I constructed the cloth model using point masses and spring constraints. I used three types of constraints:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Structural:</strong> These constraints link each point to the point directly above it and the point directly to the left, forming a
        grid. They form the basic structure of the cloth.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Shearing:</strong> These constraints link each point to the point to its upper right and the point to its upper left, forming a grid at a 45
        degree angle. They prevent the cloth from shearing, i.e., becoming very parallelogram-shaped, with one corner far away from the corner diagonal to it.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Bending:</strong> These constraints link each point to the point two above it and the point to its left, forming a large grid along the same lines
        as the one formed by the structural constraints. This type of constraint is weaker than the other two (in this project I set it to be one fifth of their
        strength), and prevents the cloth from bending sharply and unnaturally.
    </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
    <p>In this section, I implemented the main component of the cloth simulation: the physics equations which are integrated over to calculate the point masses' positions
        at each time step. I first calculated the forces on the point masses due to gravity and the spring constraints. I then used Verlet integration to implement the logic for
        updating the positions, based on the damping constant, the difference between each mass' current position and its previous position, and the aforementioned forces.
        To prevent spring lengths from changing too dramatically, I constrained each spring to never stretch by longer than 10% of its rest length.
        To test my work, I tried changing the different parameters and observed their effects on the motion and final resting state of the cloth:

    <h2 align="middle">Part III: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
    <p>In this section, I modified the cloth to support collisions with sphere and plane primitives. In both cases, I did this by calculating a "tangent point", a projection of
        each point mass onto the shape (plane or sphere) and constraining that point mass to stay at that point when the algorithm attempts to set its position to somewhere inside
        the sphere / beneath the plane.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some cloths with different spring constants draped over the sphere. As in the last section, it's clear that a higher ks corresponds to
    a stiffer cloth which is better at supporting its own weight. The triangular patterns are not a calculation error, but an artifact of the low resolution of the
        cloth mesh. Also pictured is the result of a plane intersection.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part IV: Handling self-collisions</h2>
    <p>In this section, I modified the cloth to support self-collisions. To do this, I discretized the 3D space into boxes of width and height equal to three
        times the width and height, respectively, of one unit of cloth, and depth equal to the larger of the two. At each step, each point mass falls into one of the
        boxes, and the algorithm checks for collisions (defined as distance closer than twice the thickness of the cloth) with other point masses within the box and
        applies a repulsive force to colliding point masses. Pictured below is a combination of self collisions and plane collisions with different parameters.
